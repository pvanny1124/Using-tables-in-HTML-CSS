# Using-tables-in-HTML-CSS
Here I demonstrate how to create tables with html tags &lt;table>, &lt;th>, &lt;tr>, &lt;tfoot>, and &lt;tbody> to display employee information. This table that I have created can be read by a screen reader as well, and I added some CSS to show you how to style these types of tables in CSS.
